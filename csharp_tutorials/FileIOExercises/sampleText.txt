Hello!
I am writing this to create a sample text.
I want to practice writing in C# and using IO operations.
I really enjoy coding! 
Today I learned so many cool things, and I really need to do well.
What can I do?
Make a list of things that I should do and do them all!
I need to achieve my dreams.
Just make a good plan and keep doing what I have been doing.
I will do well. I can do well.
I got this.
Thanks!!!!
